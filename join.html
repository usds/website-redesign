        <p class="faq-answer">We would love for all of our Fellows to find jobs with the City or other government organizations! Over the course of each fellow's term, we work to connect them with City departments, state and federal agencies, civic technology companies, and public policy organizations that are looking for talent, and we encourage our partnering departments in the City to consider Fellows as candidates for regular City positions.</p>
        <p>Fellows who would like to continue on their projects or help manage the next round of the program can request to extend their assignments, which would be considered through an evaluation process.</p>

        <h4 id="location" class="faq-heading">Where will the work be located?</h4>
        <p class="faq-answer">We’re currently working with our Facilities team to reserve dedicated office space for Fellows and their project teams, which will be located near our current office space at City Hall (301 W 2nd Street). We also travel to different areas in central Austin based on the needs of specific projects, and we host meetings and events in different spaces throughout the year.</p>
        <p>We have a strong appreciation for the effectiveness of working from home, so our telework policy allows Fellows to work from home at least one day each week.</p>

        <h4 id="typical-day" class="faq-heading">What will a typical day look like?</h4>
        <p class="faq-answer">Fellows serve on multidisciplinary teams of designers, developers, user researchers, and subject matter experts using scrum and other agile methods to manage work and ensure frequent collaboration.</p>
        <p>A typical day includes a stand-up with your core team and plenty of time for you to focus on advancing the project based on your skills and expertise. Depending on the needs of your project, you’ll also meet with users, stakeholders, and other city departments on a daily or weekly basis. At the end of each week, all of the fellows teams take time to share progress and learnings across projects and teach each other new skills.</p>
