        Millions of Americans interact with government services every day. Veterans apply for benefits.
        Students compare financial aid options. Small business owners seek loans. Too often, outdated tools and complex systems
        make these interactions cumbersome and frustrating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter the United States Digital Service. We partner leading technologists with dedicated public servants to improve the usability and reliability of our government's most important digital services.

      </h3>
      <p>
        We&#8217;re working with leaders across Veterans Affairs (VA) to build Vets.gov, a simple, easy to use site that consolidates information for Veterans. <a href="https://www.vets.gov/playbook/">One website&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;not thousands</a>. Vets.gov launched in November 2015 in beta to provide tools and resources that are easy to find and use. Veterans are actively testing the site so we can learn, as we build, what is working for them and what is not. As the site progresses, Veterans will be able to find and access more of what they need in one place.

      <h3><a href="https://my.uscis.gov/">Digital Immigration</a></h3>
      <p>
    We&#8217;re supporting U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (USCIS) in digitizing the review process for over seven million annual immigration applications and requests. An increasing percentage of the immigration system is now online, including the green card renewal application (I-90), which has a 93% user satisfaction rate. Improvements to software development practices, system architecture, and design make it easier for users to interact with our immigration system.

Millions of students have already benefited from this data, the most comprehensive and reliable ever published on employment outcomes and success in repaying student loans. By giving developers access to an API, they can create more customized tools to help students find the right school.

        &#8220;I&#8217;m honored that I&#8217;ve found a way to serve my country and help those who need it most. Not to

        &#8220;Some challenges are so big and complex that only technology and government can solve
        them. Tackling our nation&#8217;s most important issues from this angle is the most
        rewarding work I&#8217;ve ever done. I&#8217;ve never been more certain that this is where our country&#8217;s energy,
        intellect, and innovation should be focused.&#8221;
