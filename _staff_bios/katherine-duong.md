bio: |
  My love for making things started at a young age and I eventually studied architecture at University of California, Berkeley. Through this journey, I realized my real passion was in designing for human needs and experiences. Since then, I’ve been tackling the complex worlds of healthcare and local government with human-centered design tools.
