bio: |
  Maura is interested in understanding humans— their behaviors, interactions, and communities— and exploring what makes people 'tick.' Maura believes that to achieve sustainable progress and change in the world, we must use a human-centered, empathetic approach in the development of interventions, services, programs, and policies. She has been advocating for human rights since 2011, and she moved to Austin in 2014 to tackle homelessness as an AmeriCorps permanent supportive housing case manager.
