bio: |
  I’m a researcher and multi-disciplinary designer, working to strengthen communities and accessibility in Austin, Texas. Titles can't sum up who a person is, but I've held a few positions that shape my perspectives & curiosities: interaction designer, researcher, visual director, business owner, manager, waitress. After working with some pretty inspiring companies, I attended the Austin Center for Design to learn how to apply my experience to bigger social & environmental challenges.
