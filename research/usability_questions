## Top tasks:

- Apply for a job
- Learn what the team is, and why you'd want to join

## Technical concerns

- Do folks need visual indication that the logo is a link to the home page?
- Name of about page -- info graphic vs home page

## Outline

Thanks for your help today! We'll be looking at a new website together. Your help today will result in the government doing a better job of hiring engineers, designers, and others to help better serve Veterans, students, and more. Thank you! It's important to remember that you're not being tested -- the site is being tested. Every thing that is hard or confusing for you will be hard and confusing for other people. Do you have any questions before we get started?

We're going to run you through some scenarios.

1. Let's say you want to work at USDS. Sign up for a job there.

2. Go back to the home page.

3. What is the Digital Service?

4. What are two examples of projects that this team has worked on?

5. How many people work at the Digital Service?

6. Would you actually apply for a job here? Why? Why not?
