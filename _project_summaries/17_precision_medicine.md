Announced in the 2015 State of the Union, the Precision Medicine Initiative is a new effort to revolutionize how we improve health and treat disease by taking each unique person&#8217;s genes, environment, and lifestyle into account. The U.S. Digital Service team at the Department of Health &amp; Human Services is working to enable this medical transformation, partnering with NIH and VA to build their volunteer research platforms and the supporting technology, with the goal of gaining new insights for the development of individualized care.
