In partnership with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), we&#8217;re developing a more efficient procurement process for IT goods and services. To start, we posted on Challenge.gov, asking for training program ideas to make contracting officers successful in the era of digital government. The challenge winner created a training pilot to test with 30 contracting officers, who will complete the program empowered to act as business advisors to their agencies on digital service procurements.
