For small business owners, navigating the contractor certification process is burdensome, involving hours of paperwork and manually scanning dozens of documents. We assisted the Small Business Administration (SBA) in establishing an agile procurement to modernize technology and streamline the certification process. The newly launched certify.SBA.gov saves small businesses time and money, and it increases the SBA&#8217;s capacity to provide small businesses access to federal contracting space and capital.
