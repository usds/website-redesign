We worked with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to launch a digital approval
stamp process for Federal agencies processing refugees who have already been interviewed in-person, and who 
have cleared all security and background checks. More than 57% of cases require this action, so having the
flexibility to conduct it from any location at any time is a significant benefit. The digital stamp approval
process is the team’s first step towards modernizing the refugee admissions process by increasing officer
efficiency and reducing wait time for applicants, while upholding rigorous security standards.
