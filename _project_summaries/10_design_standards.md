[Built in collaboration with 18F designers and developers](https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/introducing-u-s-web-design-standards-aff21383afd6#.1vunnmtyr), we created the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards to bring consistency and good user experience to government websites. This new UI system provides guidance for creating easy-to-use digital interfaces by unifying visual language and interaction patterns that meet high standards of web accessibility.
