Working with the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Digital Service introduced Secure Access, 
a user verification process that relies on strong identity proofing and two-factor authentication 
to protect users’ sensitive tax records.  Secure Access ensures that users have convenient, real-time 
access to their transcripts while protecting taxpayer information from automated fraudulent attacks.
