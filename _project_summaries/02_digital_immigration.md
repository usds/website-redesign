We’re supporting U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) in digitizing the review process for over seven million annual immigration applications and requests. An increasing percentage of the immigration system is now online, including the green card renewal application (I-90), which has a 93% user satisfaction rate. Improvements to software development practices, system architecture, and design make it easier for users to interact with our immigration system.
