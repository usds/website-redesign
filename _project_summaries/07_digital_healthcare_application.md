Working with VA, we introduced a new digital application for healthcare built with Veterans, not for them.
Previously, less than 10 percent of applicants used the Veteran Online Application for a simple reason: 
the form—a fillable PDF that required Veterans to use Adobe 8 or 9 via Internet Explorer—would not open 
for most users. In the 30 days following the launch of the digital application, more than 11,600 Veterans
used it to apply for healthcare, with many receiving coverage in less than 10 minutes.
