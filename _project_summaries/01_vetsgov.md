We're working with leaders across Veterans Affairs (VA) to build Vets.gov, a simple, easy-to-use site that consolidates information for Veterans. [One website&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;not thousands](https://www.vets.gov/playbook). Vets.gov launched in November 2015 in beta to provide tools and resources that are easy-to-find and use. Veterans are actively testing the site so we can learn, as we build, what is working for them and what is not. As the site progresses, Veterans will be able to find and access more of what they need in one place.
