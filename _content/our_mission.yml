  heading_title: "The USDS origin story"
  origin_story_text: |-
    Too often, outdated tools, systems, and practices make interacting with the government cumbersome and frustrating. The challenges behind the rollout of [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) made clear that accessing government services should be as easy as ordering a book online.

    Founded by President Obama in August of 2014, the U.S. Digital Service brought together the best engineering, design, and government talent to change our government’s approach to technology. We planned to hire ten people for three critical national priorities: modernizing immigration, Veterans’ benefits, and [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/). During the 2015 State of the Union address, we launched an online application to join the team. We worried if ten people would even apply. 1000 did.

    We quickly went to work with a simple strategy:

    > Recruit top designers, engineers, product managers, and digital policy experts. Pair these digital experts with our nation’s leading civil servants. Deploy these teams to untangle the most important government services, together.

    We’re proud of everything we’ve worked for since. The team we’ve assembled has relocated to Washington, D.C., from more than 20 states and territories and counting. They're enthusiastic about emoji, laptop stickers, and scanning the Federal Register. Does this sound like you? [Apply now.](site.baseurl/apply)
