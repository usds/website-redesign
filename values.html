          <h3>Hire and empower great people.</h3>
          Technology alone doesn&#8217;t change things&#8202;—&#8202;it&#8217;s
          the people who push our mission forward. Strong EQ, compassion, and
          tenacity are just as important as being a great technologist.

        <li>
          <h3>Find the truth. Tell the truth.</h3>
          We expect our people to be humble, not quiet, and challenge the status quo
          wherever data supports it. As has been said before, everyone is entitled to
          their own opinion, but not their own facts.  </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Optimize for results, not optics.</h3>
          We work for the people&#8202;—&#8202;not credit, prestige, or headlines.
          This means tackling the hard stuff, even when success isn&#8217;t guaranteed.

          <h3>Go where the work is.</h3>
          By working shoulder to shoulder with agencies, we&#8217;re able to inspire change. 
          Transforming government is not up to the U.S. Digital Service. It&#8217;s up to all of us, together.

          <h3>Design with users, not for them.</h3>
          To deliver products and services that provide value to users, it&#8217;s essential
          that we experience their experiences. The best products and services aren&#8217;t
          created behind closed doors.
        <li>
          <h3>Create momentum.</h3>
          The American people need better digital services, today. We work with a bias 
          for action, focusing on delivery above all else.
